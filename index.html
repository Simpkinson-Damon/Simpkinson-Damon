  <h3>Notes for Brother James</h3>
  <p>This first submission is broken into 2 separate sites there is a link and a description of each below<br/>
     I will try to keep future submssions to one site at a time but one of the sites was pretty much already<br/>
     built as a project for a previous class and filled a need to demonstrate understanding of a concept for<br/>
     this class</p>
  <p>Any necessary instructions are included on each individual page</p>
  <br/>
  <a href="submissionOne/subOne.html"><h3>Sub 1</h3></a>
  <p> This submission includes demonstrations of JS variables, loops, conditionals, functions and paramters<br/>
      It also includes DOM manipulation using createElement, createTextNode, appendChild and removeChild.</p>
  <a href="https://shielded-forest-33998.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank"><h3>Sub 1a (opens in new window)</h3></a>
  <p>This submission includes demonstrations of using XMLHTTPRequest to request JSON data from a web service.<br/>
     This site also displays JSON parse and stringify as well as DOM manipulation similar to the first part<br/>
     of the submission. Some of the DOM manipulation for this project was done using JQuery originally and I<br/>
     left those parts of the code in place, the manipuation in the first part of the submission is done<br/>
     entirely in JavaScript.
