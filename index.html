<h3>Notes for Brother James</h3>
<p>These were tested on Firefox.  There seemed to be some occasional technical<br/>
   difficulties when using Chrome.</p>
<p>New material in Sub 2 link.</p>
<a href="submissionTwo/subTwo.html"><h3>Sub 2</h3></a>
<p>A sample of DOM manipulation, Manipulating CSS properties with JS, HTML5 tags and basic CSS Transitions</p>
<a href="submissionOne/subOne.html"><h3>Sub 1</h3></a>
<p>This submission includes demonstrations of JS variables, loops, conditionals, functions and paramters<br/>
    It also includes DOM manipulation using createElement, createTextNode, appendChild and removeChild.</p>
<a href="https://shielded-forest-33998.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank"><h3>Sub 1a (opens in new window)</h3></a>
<p>This submission includes demonstrations of using XMLHTTPRequest to request JSON data from a web service.<br/>
    This site also displays JSON parse and stringify as well as DOM manipulation similar to the first part<br/>
    of the submission. Some of the DOM manipulation for this project was done using JQuery originally and I<br/>
    left those parts of the code in place, the manipuation in the first part of the submission is done<br/>
    entirely in JavaScript.
