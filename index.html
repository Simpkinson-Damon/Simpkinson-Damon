<h3>Notes for Brother James</h3>
<p>Final Project Submission.  This is a Disney Themed app that is based in part on my app<br/>
   from submission 1.  The instructions front page is pretty self explanitory, mouse over the<br/>
   picture of the theme park you would like information on and click.  The name will appear<br/>
   underneath the picture of the park when you hover over it.  You can flip over the cards<br/>
   after they appear for additional information about that attraction.<br/>
   It is worth mentioning that this app returns park information in real time so if the park<br/>
   is closed when you check then you will not get any information from the app.<br/>
   It is also worth mentioning that sometimes the Themepark API running on the server side<br/>
   can be slow.  If it feels like it is taking too long pick a different theme park and then<br/>
   come back.</p>

<p>A sample of DOM manipulation, Manipulating CSS properties with JS, HTML5 tags and basic CSS Transitions</p>
<a href="submissionOne/subOne.html"><h3>Sub 1 (Already Checked)</h3></a>
<p>This submission includes demonstrations of JS variables, loops, conditionals, functions and paramters<br/>
    It also includes DOM manipulation using createElement, createTextNode, appendChild and removeChild.</p>
<a href="https://shielded-forest-33998.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank"><h3>Sub 1a (Already Checked)</h3></a>
<p>This submission includes demonstrations of using XMLHTTPRequest to request JSON data from a web service.<br/>
    This site also displays JSON parse and stringify as well as DOM manipulation similar to the first part<br/>
    of the submission. Some of the DOM manipulation for this project was done using JQuery originally and I<br/>
    left those parts of the code in place, the manipuation in the first part of the submission is done<br/>
    entirely in JavaScript.
