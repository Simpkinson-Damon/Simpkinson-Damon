<h3>Notes for Brother James</h3>
<p>Submission Four: This submission covers the last of the skills I have remaining<br/>
   This will take user input and store the data and then on a new page the data will<br/>
   be retrieved and used to create a barChart object. The barchart object will be<br/>
    created using the canvas tag which will hopefully bump me up for my HTML5 tags also</p>
<a href="submissionFour/subFour.html"><h3>Sub 4</h3></a>
<a href="submissionThree/subThree.html"><h3>Sub 3 (Already Checked)</h3></a>
<a href="submissionTwo/subTwo.html"><h3>Sub 2 (Already Checked)</h3></a>
<p>A sample of DOM manipulation, Manipulating CSS properties with JS, HTML5 tags and basic CSS Transitions</p>
<a href="submissionOne/subOne.html"><h3>Sub 1 (Already Checked)</h3></a>
<p>This submission includes demonstrations of JS variables, loops, conditionals, functions and paramters<br/>
    It also includes DOM manipulation using createElement, createTextNode, appendChild and removeChild.</p>
<a href="https://shielded-forest-33998.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank"><h3>Sub 1a (Already Checked)</h3></a>
<p>This submission includes demonstrations of using XMLHTTPRequest to request JSON data from a web service.<br/>
    This site also displays JSON parse and stringify as well as DOM manipulation similar to the first part<br/>
    of the submission. Some of the DOM manipulation for this project was done using JQuery originally and I<br/>
    left those parts of the code in place, the manipuation in the first part of the submission is done<br/>
    entirely in JavaScript.
